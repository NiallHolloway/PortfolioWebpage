                    <h1><i>A Little Bit About Me</i></h1>
                    <p>I am currently in my third year of study meaning that I am on placement this year. I am working
                        for a payment security company called CyberSource as an Intern Software Engineer. I decided to
                        study Computing Science at University as I have always liked to put things together - from a
                        young age I have always been tinkering - and eventually I decided to start toying with computers
                        and software. I haven't looked back since. At the minute I am currently working on developing
                        web applications using a number of Javascript frameworks.</p>

                    <h1><i>Technology</i></h1>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember technology has played an important role in my life. One of my
                        personal favourite aspects of working in the computing industry is that I get to stay up to date
                        with the latest tools and technologies available, which can include anything from software such
                        as Jenkins, to the latest gadgets on the market such as Virtual Reality. In an ever growing
                        industry it is fantastic to see the diversity of applications available. Learning and
                        understanding new things is a passion of mine, and studying Computing Science gives me the
                        opportunity to experience and develop my skills in technologies that I know and that are
                        unfamiliar.</p>

                    <p>Outside the world of computing I like to keep busy experiencing new challenges. I have recently
                        got into sport and fitness and have entered a number of 10km runs which will raise money for
                        charities in Northern Ireland including Marie Curie and the Southern Area Hospice. On the
                        subject of sports I am also a keen follower of Liverpool Football Club. I believe it is
                        important to follow things close to your heart and enjoy what you do. Aside from sports I have a
                        several other interests which include classic literature and video gaming. </p>

                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>I have been working with Java for a few years now. In that time I have developed a range of
                    applications from simple projects to working on real world application Java code. I have also used
                    many tools associated with Java development including Spring Boot and Maven.</p>

                <p>I have used HTML to develop a range of web pages from simple projects at the beginning to more
                    ambitious projects, the most ambitious of which would currently be this website. In the future I
                    want to be able to develop full stack web applications and my knowledge of HTML will be useful.</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>As with HTML I have used CSS to help style and develop the webpages that I have built. The ability to
                    design and edit a page to look and feel how you want it to is an important skill. More recently I
                    have adapted the use of BootStrap to help me make webpages much more responsive.</p>

                    quite straightforward and easy to follow. I would like to add a blog section to this webpage using
                    the Ruby on Rails framework.</p>

                    and other tools has helped me to understand how beneficial it is in terms of development to be
